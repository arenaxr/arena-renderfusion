# ARENA RenderFusion

High-quality remote/split rendering on the web! Stream Unity scenes into the browser using RenderFusion with [ARENA](https://arenaxr.org/)!

RenderFusion is a form of "remote rendering", which uses a nearby powerful machine to render 3D content and streams the rendering results to a web browser. RenderFusion also employs "split rendering", which renders some portions of the 3D scene locally on the browser to reduce latency.

Note: this is an *experimental* ARENA feature, but is deployed on the main branch, so it works out the box!

## Requirements

We implement a custom layer on top of Unity's [WebRTC package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.webrtc@3.0/manual/index.html). See their [Requirements](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.webrtc@3.0/manual/requirements.html).

## Usage

See [Installation](Documentation~/install.md) section. *For AR/VR clients, it is HIGHLY reccomeneded you use this package in __URP__ for the best performance.*

Once you have the relevant packages installed, press Play on the Unity Editor or build the Unity application, then enter the ARENA scene (`https://arenaxr.org/<ARENA User Name>/<Scene Name>`) on a web browser!

## Alternate Server Usage

In addition to the above, you may deploy your own ARENA webserver if you do not wish to use our test deployment server at [arenaxr.org](https://arenaxr.org). You can follow our setup guidelines in [arenaxr/arena-services-docker](https://github.com/arenaxr/arena-services-docker), to run your own server.

## Samples

### Universal Render Pipeline (recommended)
Open `Samples~/URP`.

### Standard Render Pipeline
Open `Samples~/SRP`.

### High Definition Render Pipeline
Open `Samples~/HDRP`.

## Quick Start

For a quick start, simply open `Samples~/URP` using the Unity Hub. Click on the `ARENARenderFusion` Game Object, change the Scene Name to your favorite ARENA scene, then press Play!
