# Contributing to ARENA Renderfusion

The general Contribution Guide for all ARENA projects can be found [here](https://docs.arenaxr.org/content/contributing.html).

This document covers **development rules and conventions** specific to this repository. These rules are mandatory for all contributors, including automated/agentic coding tools.

## Development Rules

### 1. MQTT Topics — Always Use the `TOPICS` Constructor

**Never hardcode MQTT topic strings.** All topic paths must be constructed using the local `TOPICS` string constructor for ease of future topics modulation. This enables future topic format refactoring without scattered string updates.

### 2. Dependencies — Pin All Versions

**All dependencies must use exact, pegged versions** (no `^`, `~`, or `*` ranges). This prevents version drift across environments and ensures reproducible builds for security.

## Local Development

To develop `arena-renderfusion` locally:
1. Install standard C++/CMake build tools.
2. Execute the setup scripts or use standard `cmake .. && make` pipelines to build the application.
3. Ensure the `config.json` uses the correct endpoints.

## Code Style
- Follow standard C++ coding conventions.
- Provide explicit error trapping for 3D streaming sockets.

The `arena-renderfusion` uses [Release Please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) to automate CHANGELOG generation and semantic versioning. Your PR titles *must* follow Conventional Commit standards (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`).

> [!CAUTION]
> **Never use `BREAKING CHANGE` in commit/PR bodies or the `!` suffix on commit/PR types (e.g., `feat!:`, `fix!:`).** These tokens cause release-please to automatically bump the major version. Major version increments are reserved for the maintainer's explicit decision — contributors and agents do not decide what constitutes a breaking change for semver purposes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Issue and PR References in Commit & PR Messages:**
> Only use `#NN` notation in commit messages, PR titles, and PR descriptions if they correspond to actual GitHub issues or pull requests. Do **not** use `#NN` notation for internal enumerations of planning docs or triage items (e.g., use `Task NN` or plain text instead), as this creates erroneous links and may result in unintended automatic actions.


## CI & Dependency Management Conventions
- **GitHub Actions Tag SHA Pinning**: All GitHub Action references in `.github/workflows/` MUST be pinned to the exact commit SHA of the official release tag (e.g., `uses: actions/checkout@11d5960a326750d5838078e36cf38b85af677262 # v4.4.0`).
- **Inline Version Comments**: The inline comment next to the SHA MUST specify the exact tag version used. This enables Dependabot to recognize the release version, generate human-readable SemVer PR titles (`from X.Y.Z to A.B.C`), and automatically update version comments during upgrades.
